            `I'm Bernardo Araújo Iannini, 19 years old, a Web and Mobile Development student at COTEMIG and Full Stack Developer at Inspire4U, where I build digital solutions, web platforms and innovation projects.

I currently work on the Athena 7 ecosystem, a platform focused on whistleblowing channels, women's protection in corporate environments, NR-1 compliance support, and corporate education. On this project, I work across different parts of the product — from interfaces and features to integrations, improvements and platform architecture.

I have hands-on experience with C#, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Flutter and Python, as well as exposure to other modern development technologies. I'm also into video editing and creation, an area where I've already shipped award-winning projects and which sharpens my creative vision within technology.

Today, I'm deepening my knowledge in software development and studying cybersecurity, with a focus on tools and concepts tied to pentesting. I'm also connected to the Innovation Business Alliance, an organization with presence in Ireland, working to bring technology, innovation and real impact closer together.

I'm passionate about technology, solving problems and turning ideas into real products. I'm always looking to grow, build more complete solutions and ship well-thought-out projects for clients, users and the market.`

Atualmente, trabalho no ecossistema Athena 7, uma plataforma voltada para canais de denúncia, proteção de mulheres no ambiente corporativo, suporte à NR-1 e educação dentro de empresas. No projeto, atuo em diferentes partes do produto, desde interfaces e funcionalidades até integrações, melhorias e estruturação da plataforma.

Tenho experiência prática com C#, MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Flutter e Python, além de contato com outras tecnologias do desenvolvimento moderno. Também me interesso por criação e edição de vídeo, área em que já desenvolvi projetos premiados e que fortalece minha visão criativa dentro da tecnologia.

Hoje, aprofundo meus conhecimentos em desenvolvimento de software e estudo cibersegurança, com foco em ferramentas e conceitos ligados a pentest. Também sou conectado à Innovation Business Alliance, organização com presença na Irlanda, buscando aproximar tecnologia, inovação e impacto real.

Sou apaixonado por tecnologia, por resolver problemas e por transformar ideias em produtos reais. Estou sempre buscando evoluir, criar soluções mais completas e entregar projetos bem pensados para clientes, usuários e mercado.`
